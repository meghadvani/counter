# React Counter App

A simple counter application built using React. This app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value. It serves as an introductory project to practice React concepts such as state, event handling, and component structure.

## Features

- **Increment**: Increases the counter by 1.
- **Decrement**: Decreases the counter by 1.
- **Reset**: Resets the counter to 0.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Using modern JavaScript features.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the app.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.js` file and ensure that you have React and ReactDOM installed in your environment.
3. Run the app in your local development environment.

### Interacting with the App:

- **Increment**: Click the **Increment** button to increase the counter by 1.
- **Decrement**: Click the **Decrement** button to decrease the counter by 1.
- **Reset**: Click the **Reset** button to reset the counter to 0.

### Example Screenshots

_Optional: Add some screenshots of the app here to show how it looks in action._

## Testing

For testing the components of the app, Jest is used in combination with React Testing Library.
